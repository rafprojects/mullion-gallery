# Future Tasks & Enhancements

This document tracks deferred and exploratory work remaining. Items promoted to active phase execution are moved into dedicated phase reports and removed from this backlog.

---

## Builder

### URL-Based Image Inputs (Mask, Overlay, Background)

**Context:** All URL-based image inputs (paste URL for mask, overlay library, background image) were disabled in Phase 20 and replaced with upload-only workflows. This simplifies the security surface (no external URL fetching, no CORS issues, no SSRF risk) and keeps all assets in the WP media library.

**What was removed:**
- `SlotPropertiesPanel`: "Paste mask URL…" TextInput for adding masks, editable URL field for existing masks.
- `LayoutBuilderMediaPanel`/`AssetUploader`: URL TextInput for graphic layer library and background image sections.
- `LayoutBuilderModal`: `handleAddUrlToLibrary()` callback that POSTed external URLs to the overlay-library endpoint.
- `BuilderDockContext`: `handleAddUrlToLibrary` from the shared context interface.

**To re-enable (if needed):**
- `AssetUploader.onUrlSubmit` is already optional — simply pass the callback to re-show the URL TextInput.
- For masks, restore the TextInput in `SlotPropertiesPanel` mask section and the URL editing field.
- Add server-side URL validation and proxying: fetch the remote image via PHP, validate its content type and size, store it in the WP uploads directory, and return the local URL. This avoids CORS and SSRF issues.
- Consider a URL allowlist or domain whitelist for additional security.

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** Low — upload-only covers the primary use case; URL import is a convenience feature for advanced users.

### LayoutBuilder — History Persistence Across Sessions

**Origin:** Phase 58 planning (2026-06-26). Surfaced while scoping the LayoutBuilder enhancements; future-task'd per user direction.

**Context:** The undo/redo stack (`useLayoutBuilderHistory`) is fresh on every edit session — reopening a template loses its history. Persisting it with the existing local draft would let users undo across sessions.

**What to implement:** Persist the history stack (or a bounded slice) alongside the localStorage draft and restore it on builder open, reconciling with the draft-restore/conflict path.

**Files:** `src/hooks/useLayoutBuilderState.ts` (history composition), the draft-restore hook.

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** Low-Medium — quality-of-life; not a headline capability.

---

### LayoutBuilder — Reusable "Symbol" / Linked-Component Slots

**Origin:** Phase 58 planning (2026-06-26). Surfaced while scoping the LayoutBuilder enhancements; future-task'd per user direction.

**Context:** Slots and groups are all independent — there is no Figma-style "component/symbol" concept where editing one instance updates every linked instance. Useful for repeated layout motifs (e.g. a captioned card reused across a template).

**What to implement:** A symbol definition + linked-instance model (shared source, per-instance position overrides), instance sync on edit, and persistence in the template schema. Significant editor + schema work.

**Files:** `src/hooks/useLayoutBuilderState.ts` (schema + sync), the Layers panel, the canvas render path.

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** Medium — power-user efficiency; large surface for a niche-but-loved feature.

---

### LayoutBuilder — Slot Constraints / Pinning (Anchor-to-Edge)

**Origin:** Phase 58 planning (2026-06-26). Surfaced while scoping the LayoutBuilder enhancements; future-task'd per user direction.

**Context:** Slots are positioned in percentages with no constraint model — they cannot be pinned to a canvas edge so they reflow predictably on resize. A constraints/pinning system is the deeper responsive model that complements the per-breakpoint overrides in [PHASE58_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE58_REPORT.md) P58-B.

**What to implement:** Per-slot anchor constraints (pin to left/right/top/bottom/center, fixed vs. stretch), resolved at render and on canvas resize, persisted in the template schema.

**Files:** `src/hooks/useLayoutBuilderState.ts` (schema + resolution), `LayoutCanvas.tsx`, the LayoutBuilder render path.

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** Medium — robust responsive behavior beyond discrete breakpoints.

---

### LayoutBuilder — Align/Distribute Keyboard Shortcuts

**Origin:** Deferred from [PHASE58_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE58_REPORT.md) P58-A (Editor UX Polish) during batch-1 execution (2026-06-26), per user direction — the binding scheme needs design before implementation. The rest of P58-A (clipboard, slot opacity, nudge steps) ships in batch 1.

**Context:** Align and distribute exist only as Layers-panel buttons (`src/components/Admin/LayoutBuilder/LayoutBuilderLayersPanel.tsx`); there are no keyboard equivalents (unlike Figma). The blocker is binding choice: nearly all single keys are taken (`N`/`H`/`V`/`F`/`?`/`[`/`]`, plus `Ctrl+Z`/`D`/`G`/`S`), and the obvious `Ctrl+Alt+Arrows` collides with OS shortcuts (Linux workspace switch, Intel-GPU screen rotation). Two candidate schemes surfaced in planning: an **"A-chord"** (press `A`, then a direction / `H` / `V`) which is conflict-free but two-step, or a single-press `Ctrl+Alt+…` combo which is faster but unreliable cross-OS.

**What to implement:**
- Decide the binding scheme (A-chord vs. single-press combo) and document it in `src/components/Admin/LayoutBuilder/BuilderKeyboardShortcutsModal.tsx`.
- Extract the group-aware alignment closure at `LayoutBuilderLayersPanel.tsx:110-168` into a reusable `src/hooks/useSlotAlignment.ts` (`useSlotAlignment(builder)`) so both the Layers panel and `useLayoutBuilderKeyboardHandlers.ts` call the same logic.
- Wire the chosen bindings in `src/hooks/useLayoutBuilderKeyboardHandlers.ts`, gated on `selectedSlotIds.size >= 2` and `!isPreview`.

**Acceptance:** align/distribute invokable from the keyboard, matching the Layers-panel buttons, with 2+ slots selected.

**Effort:** Small-Medium | **Impact:** Low-Medium — power-user efficiency; the buttons already cover the capability.

### LayoutBuilder — Published Responsive Canvas Sizing (Breakpoint Render Model)

**Origin:** Deferred from [PHASE58_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE58_REPORT.md) P58-B during implementation (2026-06-29), per user direction — needs an extensive manual-testing pass plus careful planning before committing to a model.

**Context:** P58-B ships per-breakpoint slot overrides + a builder boundary guide, and the published gallery now renders a non-desktop breakpoint as the **centered device-width band** of the design canvas, **scaled to fill** the container (`computeBreakpointBand` in `packages/shared-utils/src/breakpointViewport.ts`) — a "full-height vertical slice, scale-to-fill" model. It works, but on-page sizing is still imperfect: the layout is constrained left/right (the band is centered and the rest of the design canvas is hidden), and because tablet/mobile scale the band to the container, **slots get progressively smaller as the breakpoint narrows**. There is no per-breakpoint canvas aspect/height — mobile inherits the desktop canvas height as a tall, narrow slice. A better model would let the published layout size itself to the page more naturally across breakpoints.

**What to implement:** Define and validate a published responsive sizing model that avoids the "everything shrinks" effect and the rigid left/right constraint. Candidate directions: per-breakpoint canvas height/aspect on the template schema; container-relative sizing with min/max clamps; or integration with the **Slot Constraints / Pinning** entry above (the deeper responsive complement). Requires a broad manual-testing matrix (real devices + container widths × fixed-width vs fit-to-container templates × aspect ratios) and careful planning before code.

**Files:** `packages/shared-utils/src/breakpointViewport.ts`, `src/components/Galleries/Adapters/layout-builder/LayoutBuilderGallery.tsx`, the template `canvas*` / `breakpointOverrides` schema, `src/hooks/useLayoutBuilderState.ts`.

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** Medium-High — directly governs how published layouts look on real devices.

---

### LayoutBuilder — Faithful Preview (Breakpoint Render + Runtime Effects)

**Origin:** Deferred from [PHASE58_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE58_REPORT.md) P58-B (2026-06-29), per user direction.

**Context:** Two preview gaps. **(1)** The builder's internal **Preview** mode (`LayoutCanvas` in `isPreview`, inside the device-frame) is a *separate* render path from the published `LayoutBuilderGallery`. After the P58-B publish-at-breakpoint fix the published/campaign render shows the centered band correctly, but the builder's Preview toggle does not necessarily match — it renders the design canvas inside the device frame rather than reusing the gallery's crop+scale band model. **(2)** Preview does not exercise the runtime effects the published gallery applies — per-slot glow, hover bounce/pop, entrance (scroll-reveal) animations, tilt — so the user cannot quickly validate a layout's interactive feel without actually publishing.

**What to implement:** (a) Align the builder Preview render with the published gallery's breakpoint model (centered band, scale-to-fill) so **Preview = published**; reusing `LayoutBuilderGallery` (or its crop+scale logic via `computeBreakpointBand`) in Preview mode is the cleanest path. (b) Render the runtime effects (glow, bounce/hover, entrance animations, tilt) in Preview the same way the gallery does (`buildTileStyles` / `buildBoxShadowStyles`, `buildSlotEntranceCss`, `TiltWrapper`) so effects are validatable in-builder.

**Files:** `src/components/Admin/LayoutBuilder/LayoutCanvas.tsx`, `src/components/Admin/LayoutBuilder/LayoutBuilderCanvasPanel.tsx`, sharing with `src/components/Galleries/Adapters/layout-builder/LayoutBuilderGallery.tsx`, `src/utils/slotEntrance.ts`, and `src/components/Galleries/Adapters/_shared/tileHoverStyles.ts`.

**Effort:** Medium-High | **Impact:** Medium — faster design iteration and correctness confidence before publish.

---

### LayoutBuilder — Clickable / Linking CTA Text Layer

**Origin:** Deferred from [PHASE59_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE59_REPORT.md) during P59 planning (2026-06-29), per user direction — Phase 59 ships single-style text layers with semantic roles (heading/subheading/paragraph/caption) rendered as real DOM text (Decision B: single-style text for v1); the linking/CTA variant was split off to keep v1 to pure, non-interactive text.

**Context:** Phase 59 text layers (`LayoutTextLayer` in `src/types/index.ts`; render path in `LayoutBuilderGallery.tsx`, P59-C) render as non-interactive semantic text — a heading or caption, not a link. A common layout need is a **call-to-action**: text that navigates somewhere when clicked (e.g. "Shop now"). That requires a link target on the layer plus interactive, accessible rendering — more than "style a string."

**What to implement:**
- Add an optional `href` (+ link behavior, e.g. same-tab/new-tab) to `LayoutTextLayer`; absent = plain text, so existing text layers stay back-compatible.
- Render a CTA layer as a real anchor (`<a>` / `role="link"`) with correct keyboard focus + Enter/Space activation and an accessible name — reuse the slot click/keydown a11y pattern already in `LayoutBuilderGallery.tsx` (`role`/`tabIndex`/key handling).
- Add a URL field + link controls to `TextPropertiesPanel.tsx` (the P59-B panel), and decide Pro-gating placement (text layers are flagged as a natural Pro feature in P59 Decision D / [PHASE62_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE62_REPORT.md)).
- Sanitize the URL on save and on render.

**Files:** `src/types/index.ts` (`LayoutTextLayer`), `src/components/Admin/LayoutBuilder/TextPropertiesPanel.tsx`, `src/components/Galleries/Adapters/layout-builder/LayoutBuilderGallery.tsx`.

**Depends on:** the Phase 59 text-layer schema + render path (P59-A landed 2026-06-30; P59-B/P59-C pending).

**Effort:** Small-Medium | **Impact:** Medium — unlocks CTA/banner layouts (a primary reason to put text on a gallery) without an external image editor.

---

### LayoutBuilder — Right-Click / Long-Press Contextual Menu

**Origin:** Raised by the user during [PHASE59_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE59_REPORT.md) P59-F planning (2026-07-01) as a follow-on idea, explicitly not urgent — sized as a future UX investment rather than something to build now.

**Context:** The LayoutBuilder currently exposes actions through two menu surfaces only: the top `Menu`-bar dropdowns (`LayoutBuilderMenuBar.tsx` — File/Edit/View, global scope) and the per-row `Menu` inside `LayerRow.tsx` (Layers-panel row actions). There is **no context menu anywhere on the canvas itself** — verified during P59-F research. A right-click (or long-press, for touch) menu on a canvas object is a standard design-tool convention (Figma, Photoshop, Canva) for fast, targeted actions without leaving the canvas or hunting through a side panel.

**What to implement:**
- A contextual menu component triggered by right-click (`onContextMenu`) and long-press on canvas targets, positioned at the cursor/touch point.
- Per-target-type action sets — the menu contents vary by what's under the cursor: a slot, overlay, text layer, group, or guide. Likely shared actions (delete, duplicate, bring-to-front/send-to-back, lock/hide) plus type-specific ones.
- Needs to compose with the builder's existing single-selection-per-type model (`selectedOverlayId`/`selectedTextId`/`selectedSlotIds`/etc. in `LayoutBuilderModal.tsx`) — right-clicking an unselected item should likely select it first, mirroring how most design tools handle this.
- Reuse the existing action handlers already wired to the Edit menu and Layers-panel rows (`handleDeleteSelected`, `handleDuplicateSelected`, `bringToFront`/`sendToBack`, etc. in `LayoutBuilderModal.tsx`/`useLayoutBuilderState.ts`) rather than duplicating logic — the contextual menu should be a new *trigger surface* for actions that already exist, not a new action-implementation layer.

**Files:** New component under `src/components/Admin/LayoutBuilder/` (e.g. a `LayoutBuilderContextMenu.tsx`); wiring touches `LayoutCanvas.tsx` (attach `onContextMenu`/long-press handlers per target) and `LayoutBuilderModal.tsx` (action dispatch, selection-on-right-click).

**Depends on:** No hard dependency, but [PHASE59_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE59_REPORT.md) P59-F (guide delete-icon + keyboard delete) is a natural first candidate action this menu would eventually expose for guides — P59-F solves guide deletion directly rather than waiting on this larger system.

**Effort:** Medium-Large (new UI infrastructure: positioning, per-type action-set logic, touch long-press handling, keyboard/a11y for the menu itself) | **Impact:** Medium — meaningful workflow speedup for power users, matches conventions from professional design tools, but existing menu surfaces (Edit menu, Layers-panel row actions) already cover the same actions today, just less directly.

## Code Quality & Refactoring

### Roll Out `UnitScrubField` to Remaining Ad Hoc Numeric/Unit Inputs

**Origin:** Surfaced during [PHASE59_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE59_REPORT.md) P59-D planning (2026-06-30), per user direction — P59-D itself stays scoped to `TypographyEditor`'s 8 CSS-unit fields; the app-wide rollout is explicitly deferred.

**Context:** P59-D extracts `UnitScrubField` (`src/components/Common/UnitScrubField.tsx`) — a shared `NumberInput` + unit `Select` + drag-to-scrub control — and migrates `DimensionInput` (`src/components/Settings/DimensionInput.tsx`) and the new `CssValueInput` (`src/components/Common/CssValueInput.tsx`, used by `TypographyEditor`) onto it as thin, contract-preserving adapters. That leaves at least one known ad hoc numeric input outside the new pattern, and likely others not yet inventoried.

**What to implement:**
- Migrate the bespoke rotation-degree scrub in `src/components/Admin/LayoutBuilder/SlotPropertiesPanel.tsx:567-613` onto a `UnitScrubField`-based adapter. This is a different value domain (plain degrees, not a CSS unit) so it needs its own thin adapter — not `CssValueInput`, which is CSS-string-shaped.
- Audit Settings and LayoutBuilder property panels (`src/components/Settings/`, `src/components/Admin/LayoutBuilder/`) for any other free-text CSS-value inputs or raw `NumberInput`s without unit safety that predate P59-D, and migrate the good candidates onto `DimensionInput`/`CssValueInput`/`UnitScrubField` for visual consistency and scrub support.

**Files:** `src/components/Admin/LayoutBuilder/SlotPropertiesPanel.tsx` (rotation scrub), `src/components/Common/UnitScrubField.tsx`, `src/components/Common/CssValueInput.tsx`, `src/components/Settings/DimensionInput.tsx`.

**Effort:** Small-Medium (rotation migration is contained; the audit scope depends on what the sweep finds) | **Impact:** Low-Medium — consistency and scrub-everywhere polish, not a functional gap.

*"`AdminPanel.tsx` — Extract the Remaining Tab-State Concerns (P70-H remainder)" was promoted to [PHASE72_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE72_REPORT.md) track **P72-E** (2026-07-23) and removed from this backlog.*

---

### `ApiClient` Facade → Namespaces

**Origin:** [PHASE70_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE70_REPORT.md) Follow-On Candidates, track **P70-E** (Planning Decision C, deferred 2026-07-21).

**Context:** `ApiClient` is a single flat facade class with ~70 call sites across the front end. Splitting it into per-domain namespaces (e.g. `apiClient.campaigns.*`, `apiClient.media.*`) would improve discoverability and file size, but is a long-tail incremental codemod behind deprecated shims — not a single bounded change.

**Effort:** Medium-Large (spread across ~70 call sites) | **Impact:** Low-Medium — maintainability only, nothing broken today. **Start whenever convenient**, not phase-scheduled; a natural fit for opportunistic touch-ups alongside unrelated work in files that import `ApiClient`.

---

### Promote Inline Sub-Components (large-file decomposition, opportunistic)

**Origin:** [PHASE70_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE70_REPORT.md) Follow-On Candidates, track **P70-I** (Planning Decision C, deferred 2026-07-21).

**Context:** Several 900+-line files (e.g. `AdminPanel.tsx`, others surfaced during Phase 70 planning) define sub-components inline rather than as extracted, independently-testable files. Deferred deliberately as **opportunistic by design** — "do each file as it's next touched" — rather than a big-bang decomposition across all six candidate files in one pass, which would create churn without a behavior benefit.

**Effort:** Medium, spread thin across many files | **Impact:** Low — maintainability/readability only. No phase scheduling intended; revisit per-file whenever that file is next substantially touched for an unrelated reason.

---

### Contract Tests — Frontend Request Payloads vs. REST Route-Arg Enums

**Origin:** [PHASE75_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE75_REPORT.md) § Follow-On Candidates, from track **P75-I** (2026-08-26).

**Context:** P75-I was a two-phase-old, always-reproducible bug — every space access grant failed with `Invalid parameter(s): access_level` — that **both** test suites were green through, because neither suite can see the other side:

- **Vitest** asserts frontend payloads against a mocked `apiClient`. Whatever the component POSTs is "correct" by construction. `SpaceManagementView.test.tsx` did not merely miss the bug, it *asserted* it: `expect(apiClient.post).toHaveBeenCalledWith(…, { userId: 42, access_level: 'owner' })` — the exact body the server answers with `rest_invalid_param`.
- **PHPUnit** asserts the route args (`Mullion_P53D_Grant_Model_Test`: "the grant endpoint rejects non-viewer levels"). Correct, and blind to what the UI actually sends.

The failure mode is structural, not specific to `access_level`: whenever a `register_rest_route` `'enum'` narrows, nothing tells the TypeScript that sends those literals. There are currently **24 enum declarations across 6 controllers** — `access_level` (`['viewer']` ×4), `isolation_mode` (`['open','delegated']` ×2), `source` (`['company','campaign']`), `action` (`['grant','deny']`), `assetType` (`['asset','font']` ×2), `visibility`, `status`, campaign bulk `action` (`['archive','restore','delete']`), media `sort` / `type` / `source`, alert `scope` / `severity`, analytics event type, and the user-create `role` (`['subscriber','mullion_editor']`, itself renamed during the Phase 74 rebrand). Each is a live instance of the same trap.

**What to implement:** One shared, machine-checked source of truth for request-parameter enums, asserted from **both** sides. The likely shape:

1. A checked-in manifest (e.g. `docs/api/rest-enums.json`, or a TS module under `src/types/`) listing route → parameter → allowed values.
2. A **PHPUnit** test that walks the registered routes (`rest_get_server()->get_routes()`, already available in the test bootstrap — no new harness) and asserts every `'enum'` in the route args matches the manifest. This fails the moment a controller narrows or widens an enum without updating the manifest.
3. A **Vitest** guard (or a lint rule) that the frontend's literals for those parameters come from the manifest — importing the TS constants rather than typing `'owner'` inline. Making the values importable is most of the fix on its own: `spaceRoleOptions` built from a shared constant could not have drifted.

Scope decision worth settling first: whether the manifest is **hand-maintained and asserted** (simplest, catches drift at PR time, requires the PHP test to be the gate) or **generated** from the PHP routes at build time (no dual maintenance, but adds a PHP-run step to the frontend build). Hand-maintained-and-asserted is the smaller first move and does not couple the builds.

**Files:** `wp-plugin/mullion-gallery/tests/` (new route-enum test), `src/types/` (shared constants), `src/components/Admin/SpaceManagementView.tsx` + `src/components/Admin/AccessTab.tsx` + `src/hooks/useAdminAccessState.ts` (consume rather than inline), plus the other call sites for whichever enums are covered.

**Dependencies / risk:** Cross-artifact parity checks rot if they are not wired into CI — this repo has the precedent: `scripts/validate-adapter-settings-parity.mjs` broke silently in a refactor and was deleted in [PHASE76_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE76_REPORT.md) **P76-G**, superseded by a Vitest guard that says so in its own header. So the check belongs in the existing PHPUnit + Vitest runs, not in a standalone script nobody runs. Start with the four `access_level` routes (the ones with a demonstrated failure) and widen from there rather than manifesting all 24 in one pass.

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium-High — this is the class of bug that reaches users through a fully green pipeline, and P75-I proved it can survive two phases of active development on adjacent code.

### ~~Portal Admin Chrome Into the Shadow Root (remove the CSS-variable boundary)~~ — DECIDED (P77-B, 2026-09-09)

> **Decided 2026-09-09 in [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) P77-B.** Portaling into the gallery's shadow root, which this entry describes, was prototyped and measured to fail inside any transformed ancestor (the drawer lands 500px above the viewport). The accepted direction is an overlay root: a second shadow root of ours on a body-level host. The risk analysis below stayed accurate about stacking contexts and was the reason the alternative was found.

**Origin:** Deferred from [PHASE76_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE76_REPORT.md) **P76-H** Key Decision B (2026-08-27). P76-H ships option (b) — inlining the variables — and explicitly keeps this option open rather than rejecting it.

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-28 — retained for its risk analysis, not as independently actionable work.** This is now **option (a) of Track P77-B** in [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md), which decides the mount strategy as a whole rather than assuming the boundary should stay and only asking how to cross it. Do not action this entry on its own; take the track. Since it was written, P76-I-2 confirmed the boundary blocks plain stylesheets as well as CSS variables from reaching portaled chrome, and that the app also mounts inside **wp-admin** (`add_submenu_page`), not only the front end — both of which widen the problem described below.

**Context:** The Settings Panel `Drawer` and Layout Builder `Modal` are portaled by Mantine to `document.body` (`Portal.mjs:17-32`, `reuseTargetNode` default `true`). In a shadow mount — the shipped default (`main.tsx:30`) — that puts the chrome in the light DOM while every stylesheet that should theme it lives in the shadow root. A `<style>` inside a shadow root only styles that shadow tree, so nothing scoped there reaches the chrome: not Mantine's `.mullion-admin-chrome[data-mantine-color-scheme="…"]` block, and not `ThemeContext`'s `--mullion-color-*` at `:host`.

The codebase works around this per-consumer rather than structurally, and has already paid for it once: `src/styles/builder.css` themes Dockview through 22 `--mullion-builder-*` properties, so `LayoutBuilderModal` derives them via `useBuilderShellColors` and writes them as **inline styles** on a div inside the Modal. P76-H generalises that workaround; it does not remove the boundary. Each future component themed by CSS variables — an editor, a chart library, a date picker — keeps paying a smaller version of the same tax.

**What to implement:** Give the Drawer/Modal `portalProps={{ target }}` pointing at a node inside the shadow root, so chrome and stylesheets share a tree. `SettingsPanel` already resolves the shadow root for its badge sentinel (`shadowSentinelRef` → `shadowHost`), but that is the *host* element for reading computed variables, not a portal target — this needs new wiring, not a hookup. On success, `useBuilderShellColors` and the `--mullion-builder-*` inline bridge become deletable, and P76-H's `adminChromeStyles()` likely does too.

**Dependencies / risk:** This is the reason it was deferred rather than taken. The Drawer portals to `document.body` specifically to escape the host page's stacking context, so moving it inside the shadow root changes **z-index behaviour against wp-admin** — including against whatever plugins a given customer has installed — plus **focus trapping** and **click-outside** detection. That failure mode surfaces in support tickets, not in CI, which is a poor trade for closing a gap P76-D measured at 3 of 58 painted colour combinations. Re-evaluate when the variable-consuming surface grows enough to justify it; P76-H makes that cheaper, not harder, by centralising the mechanism it would replace.

**Effort:** Medium-Large (small diff, large validation surface — needs real wp-admin testing across plugin combinations) | **Impact:** Medium — architectural cleanup that removes a recurring tax, not a user-visible fix.

### Host Decoupling: Run Mullion on Any Web App ("Mullion-next")

**Origin:** User request, 2026-09-10, raised alongside the [UI dependency evaluation](UI_DEPENDENCY_EVALUATION.md). Supersedes the abandoned dual WP/non-WP experiment as the *approach*, not as the goal.

**Context:** The product is a React gallery app that currently assumes WordPress for seven host services: authentication and identity, the REST data layer, the media library, settings persistence, capabilities and roles, i18n string loading, and page embedding. Two of those already have a real seam, and it works: `src/services/auth/AuthProvider.ts` is a host-neutral interface with `WpNonceProvider` and `WpJwtProvider` behind it, and `src/services/http/HttpTransport.ts` documents in its own header that WordPress glue "lives at the wiring site" so the transport stays free of `window.__MULLION_*` reads. The remaining coupling is 44 non-test source files, concentrated in `src/hooks` (13), `src/services/api` (8) and `src/components/Admin` (8).

The backend is the part with no seam at all: 32 PHP classes, about 11,000 lines, 86 registered REST routes. That is not glue around a portable core. For data, media, permissions and export it *is* the server.

**The three meanings of "decoupled", which cost wildly different amounts.** This entry cannot be promoted until the user picks one, per evaluation criterion 5:

| Meaning | What it takes | Where the existing backlog sits |
|---------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| (1) **Headless WordPress.** The SPA runs anywhere; WordPress stays the backend, reached cross-origin | JWT auth, CORS policy, build and routing changes, deployment docs. Mostly already scoped below | "JWT In-Memory Token Auth (Standalone SPA)", "CORS Origin Allow-List", "JWT Token Refresh" in **Access Control** are exactly this work, and the section intro already says so |
| (2) **Pluggable host, WordPress as one implementation.** A `HostAdapter` interface for all seven services; the WP plugin becomes the reference implementation; a second adapter (Supabase, a Node service, a static demo) proves the boundary | The 44-file frontend cleanup plus a written host contract. Backend still required per host, but each host supplies its own | New work. The auth and transport seams are the precedent to copy |
| (3) **Portable product.** A first-party non-WordPress backend so Mullion runs standalone end to end | Re-implementing the 86 REST routes and the domain logic behind them on a portable server, plus media storage, plus an install and upgrade story | New work, and by far the largest thing in this backlog |

**What to implement (recommended shape, whichever meaning is chosen):** a single codebase with one host boundary, never a fork. Define `HostAdapter` as a set of small interfaces (`AuthProvider` is already one of them) covering auth, data transport, media, settings, capabilities, i18n loading and mount/embed. Wire the concrete implementation once at the entry point, exactly as `HttpTransport` already documents. Push host-neutral code into workspace packages (`@mullion/theme-engine` is already framework-neutral with zero runtime peers, and `@mullion/shared-utils` has no dependencies) so "does this import WordPress?" becomes a lint rule rather than a judgement call.

**Why not a separate "Mullion-next" repository or build:** the user's own concern is drift, and drift is what a fork guarantees. Two builds of the same product diverge at the speed of whichever one is shipping. One codebase with one boundary and two adapters cannot drift, because the shared half has exactly one copy. The earlier dual WP/non-WP attempt is evidence for this reading rather than against it: it failed as scattered per-call-site conditionals, which is drift inside a single file rather than across two repositories. The lesson is "one seam, wired once", not "abstraction does not work here", and the auth provider shipped later on exactly that pattern and has held.

**Dependencies / risk:**
- Meaning (1) is a prerequisite for (2) and (3) in practice: the app has to survive not being same-origin before it can survive not being WordPress.
- Ordering against the in-house UI work is genuinely open. The two touch disjoint layers (component layer versus service layer), so they do not block each other, and the host boundary is what makes `@mullion/ui` cleanly publishable if that is ever wanted. Sequencing is a product call, not a technical one.
- The premium/licensing model (Freemius, `MULLION_PREMIUM` build flag) assumes a WordPress distribution channel. A non-WP host needs its own licensing answer, which is a **Monetization & Distribution** question, not an engineering one.
- The WP media library is the deepest assumption. Attachment IDs appear in campaign data, export formats and the REST contract; a media abstraction has a data-migration tail, not only an interface.

**Open questions:**
- Q1: Which of the three meanings above is the actual goal?
- Q2: If (2) or (3), what is the second host, concretely? A boundary with one implementation is a guess, exactly as P77 Key Decision A argued about the facade.
- Q3: Does the WordPress plugin remain the flagship, or become one distribution among several? This decides whether the WP adapter may keep privileged shortcuts.

**Effort:** (1) Medium-Large | (2) Large | (3) Very Large, multi-phase | **Impact:** High. It is a market-expansion item rather than a quality item, and the largest single scope increase currently in this backlog.

## Internationalization

### ~~Full Admin-Panel i18n Migration~~ — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 60-I + Phase 61)

**Origin:** Phase 54 (P54-B harvests **user-facing** strings only; admin deferred here).

**Resolved (2026-07-05, [PHASE61_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE61_REPORT.md)):** P60-I completed the admin-panel harvest; **Phase 61** swept every remaining front-end family (`Common`, `CampaignGallery`, `CardViewer`, `Auth`, `Settings`, `contexts`, `Galleries/Shared`, `App.tsx`, `ErrorBoundary.tsx`) and flipped `i18next/no-literal-string` to a single **blanket `'error'` for all of `src/**` + `packages/shared-ui/src/**`** — the terminal state, with no per-directory allow-list left to maintain. All newly-harvested strings are translated into the five shipped packs (fr/es/de/zh/ru). The WP.org public-listing i18n gate this entry described is now met.

---

### ~~i18n Review Follow-Ons — Sentence Composition + Locale Re-Translation~~ — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 61-G, one caveat)

**Origin:** Phase 60 post-phase PR/code-review (2026-07-05), deferred from [PHASE60_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE60_REPORT.md) → "Post-Phase PR / Code-Review Pass". Folded into Phase 61 Track G.

**Resolved (2026-07-05):**

1. **Sentence composition (F3).** ✅ `ArchiveCompanyModal.tsx` now composes its confirmation with a single `<Trans>` (`admin_archco_msg` / `_other`, `<strong>{{name}}</strong>` inline) — one reorderable, plural-aware unit. The pre/post fragment keys were removed. Other split-sentence cases surfaced during the P61 sweep (`NearDuplicateWarning`, `RequestAccessForm`) were also migrated to `<Trans>`.
2. **Locale re-translation.** ✅ The changed media-import toast strings (`admin_media_imported[_skipped]` + `_other` siblings) are now translated with proper singular/plural forms in all five packs; `.pot`/`.po`/`.mo`/`.l10n.php` regenerated (0 pot msgids untranslated).

**Remaining caveat (architectural, not actionable via re-translation):** the `ru_RU` **3-form** plural (`_few`/`_many`) for count-bearing strings (password-length, media counts) is **not achievable through the current i18next↔gettext bridge** — the bridge resolves translations by English string, so `_few`/`_many` (identical English to `_other`) collapse to one msgid. This is already documented in [`docs/guides/TRANSLATING.md`](guides/TRANSLATING.md) ("Russian plural nuance"); ru uses the `_other` form for counts 2–4. True 3-form correctness needs a source-layer redesign (distinct keys resolved by key, not English) and is out of scope here.

## Accessibility

### Focus Return After Closing Portaled Chrome Lands on `body`

**Origin:** [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) P77-B (2026-09-09), measured in every portal mode.

**Context:** Mantine's `useFocusReturn` records `document.activeElement` when a Drawer or Modal opens. When the trigger sits inside the gallery's shadow root that value is the shadow host, not the button, so on close focus goes to `body`. Keyboard users lose their place after every Settings panel or Layout Builder session. Independent of the shadow-versus-portal boundary decision.

**What to implement:** Capture the real trigger through `getRootNode().activeElement` (walking into shadow roots) at open time and pass it as the return target, or wrap the trigger buttons to restore focus themselves on close. Cover with an e2e assertion on `activeElement` after Escape.

**Update, 2026-09-11 (P78-B):** measured rather than described. The bake-off built the same drawer three times and probed focus after Escape: Mantine lands on `BODY`, and **both Ark UI and Base UI return focus to the trigger inside the gallery shadow root with no help from us**. So this is not work we have to do. It goes away when `Drawer` becomes a framework component on Base UI in P80-A, and the hand-rolled capture above is only worth writing if that slips or if a surface needs the fix before then. Numbers in [PHASE78_REPORT.md](PHASE78_REPORT.md) under track P78-B.

**Effort:** Small | **Impact:** Medium — WCAG 2.4.3 focus order on every admin surface.

### WordPress Admin Bar Covers the Settings Drawer Header for Logged-In Users

**Origin:** [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) P77-B (2026-09-09), measured on wordpress.lan.

**Context:** `#wpadminbar` is `position: fixed` at `z-index: 99999`; Mantine's Drawer sits at 450, so the drawer's Cancel, Save and Close buttons render under the bar on the front end whenever the admin bar is shown. Same in every portal mode.

**What to implement:** Either offset the drawer by the admin bar's height when `body.admin-bar` is present (WordPress already exposes `--wp-admin--admin-bar--height`), or raise the chrome's z-index above the bar. The offset is the more conventional choice in the WordPress ecosystem.

**Effort:** Small | **Impact:** Medium — every logged-in admin on the front end hits it.

---

### Structural a11y (axe) gate — grow coverage beyond `LayoutTemplateList`

**Origin:** [PHASE62_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE62_REPORT.md) P62-H (component structural axe harness, 2026-07-11) — the automatable half of the structural work, deferred here after the harness landed. *The concrete `LayoutTemplateList` fixes this entry used to include (icon-only SegmentedControl accessible names; nested-interactive Card/Menu button) were promoted to [PHASE72_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE72_REPORT.md) track **P72-G** (2026-07-23) — this entry now covers only the open-ended remainder below.*

**Context:** A jsdom axe harness (`src/test/axe.ts` → `expectNoA11yViolations`) runs structural WCAG A/AA checks (roles/names/labels/ARIA; contrast excluded) in the blocking Vitest CI, and `test-utils` mirrors the app's global Mantine CloseButton `aria-label`. Two clean surfaces are gated (`ConfirmModal`, `LayoutBuilderLayersPanel`); `LayoutTemplateList` becomes a third once P72-G lands. Growing the gate further is a living, component-by-component effort — the full backlog + the "how to add coverage" pattern are in [guides/ACCESSIBILITY.md](guides/ACCESSIBILITY.md) ("structural a11y backlog").

**What to implement:** Extend `expectNoA11yViolations` coverage to the remaining high-value surfaces — the LayoutBuilder property panels (Slot/Text/Graphic/Mask/Background/Image), the modals (`GalleryConfigEditorModal`, `UnifiedCampaignModal`, campaign/admin modals), `AdminPanel`, `SettingsPanel`, and the gallery adapters — fixing what each surfaces (typically missing form labels or nested interactives).

The **manual** assistive-tech audit ([guides/ACCESSIBILITY_MANUAL_AUDIT.md](guides/ACCESSIBILITY_MANUAL_AUDIT.md)) is the separate human half of P62-H.

**Status:** harness + 2 gated surfaces done (P62-H); `LayoutTemplateList` fixes scheduled as P72-G; further coverage growth remains open-ended here. **WCAG AA is a quality bar, not a hard WP.org submission gate**, so this can grow post-launch.

**Effort:** Medium (ongoing/incremental; per-surface fixes often pull in the i18n pipeline or an interaction restructure) | **Impact:** Medium — raises the public-listing a11y bar and prevents structural-a11y regressions via CI.

### ~~Two-Tone ("Halo") Focus Ring~~ — ⬆ PROMOTED to Phase 77 (P77-F)

*Promoted 2026-09-01 to [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) track **P77-F**, which absorbs
this entry's full write-up. The trigger was the designer's response to the v2 design docs
([`docs/design/correspondences/designer-response-v2-notes.md`](design/correspondences/designer-response-v2-notes.md) §4),
which endorsed building it and settled the two open design questions: the halo is a
**neutral drawn from the theme's own grounds** (never a second brand colour), and **ring
geometry stays constant across themes** (only the colours resolve). Original origin:
P76-I-2, Option D, deferred 2026-08-28 as complementary to the chosen Option A.*

## Design & Brand

### Typography Panel Redesign (layout, control choice, and the unit field)

**Origin:** User report from a deployed build, 2026-09-11, after Phase 78 closed. Diagnosed against the code the same day; not yet scheduled as work.

**Context:** Four separate problems in one panel, three of which have a named cause in the source.

1. **The panel jumps on the first edit, and a destructive control appears where the user is looking.** `TypographyEditor.tsx:231` renders the reset row only when `!isEmpty`, so choosing a font *inserts* a row above Font Family and pushes the whole panel down. The row it inserts is a single unlabelled red trash `ActionIcon` whose actual action is `onChange({})`, reset **all** overrides. It reads as "reset the font" because it appears the moment a font is chosen and sits directly above that field. A destructive, unlabelled, reset-everything control should not be the thing that appears next to the field you just edited.
2. **Line Height is the odd control in its own row.** `TypographyEditor.tsx:357` is a bare `NumberInput`, so it gets Mantine's stacked up/down spin buttons, while Letter Spacing and Word Spacing beside it in the same `<Group grow>` are `CssValueInput` scrub fields with a drag-to-adjust label. Three fields in one row, one of which behaves differently. The user's instinct is the right one: it should scrub like its neighbours. `UnitScrubField` already makes the unit selector conditional (`showUnitSelector = allowedUnits.length > 1`), so a unitless scrub variant is a small change rather than a new control.
3. **The split value/unit fields are taller than every other field in the panel.** `TypographyEditor` passes `size="xs"` to all 12 of its own `Select`s and `NumberInput`s. `UnitScrubField.tsx:86` passes no `size` at all, so every `CssValueInput` renders at Mantine's default `sm`. `CssValueInput` has no `size` prop to pass through. That is the whole cause of the height mismatch against Title Text and Color.
4. **The unit selector is a `Select` layered inside another input's `rightSection`.** `UnitScrubField.tsx:127-158` nests a `variant="unstyled"` `Select` in the `NumberInput`'s right section, sized by a hand-computed `rightSectionWidth` (`Math.max(34, longestUnit * 7 + 24)`) and held together by four `styles` overrides forcing `height: 100%` and a synthetic `borderLeft`. Mantine's `styles` prop is inline style, which is the P76-I-1 trap, and the seam between the two controls is what reads as a bad overlay. Its dropdown is also pinned `comboboxProps={{ withinPortal: false }}`, written before the overlay root existed (P77-B/P77-I), so it renders inline inside the field rather than portaling like the rest of the chrome.

**What to implement:** Redesign the panel rather than patching the four symptoms. The row grouping, the placement and labelling of reset, and the choice of control per field are design questions and should go to the designer with the current panel as the before. The number-plus-unit field is the one piece that is not a design question: it should become a single framework component with the unit as a first-class part, not a `Select` posted into another input's right section.

**Sequencing:** This is claimed by **P81-B's Settings-panel batch**, which is the first surface batch and is where `TypographyEditor`, `CssValueInput` and `UnitScrubField` are rewritten against the framework anyway. Phase 81 Decision B already makes that phase the one where pixels are allowed to move, with the designer, so the redesign lands with the migration instead of being ported forward and then fixed twice. It depends on **P80-A** shipping a number field with a unit slot; that dependency is noted in the track.

**Files:** `src/components/Common/TypographyEditor.tsx`, `src/components/Common/CssValueInput.tsx`, `src/components/Common/UnitScrubField.tsx`, `src/components/Settings/TypographySettingsSection.tsx`.

**Effort:** Medium (the unit field is the real work; the rest is layout and a designer pass) | **Impact:** Medium. The Typography panel is a primary authoring surface and currently looks unfinished next to the fields around it.

### Move the Plugin Header `Author:` / `Author URI:` to Astragal

**Origin:** Designer's endorsement-placement guidance ([`docs/design/correspondences/designer-response-2026-09-09.md`](design/correspondences/designer-response-2026-09-09.md) §3), adopted into [`DESIGN_BRIEF.md`](design/DESIGN_BRIEF.md) → House brand. Unblocked by the `astragal` WordPress.org account registration (P76-C, 2026-09-09), but deliberately not done with it.

**Context:** The house brand publishes the product, and the designer's placement rules put Astragal on exactly the provenance surfaces: the WP.org account (done), the Freemius seller of record, the GitHub organisation, and the plugin header's `Author:` / `Author URI:`. `wp-plugin/mullion-gallery/mullion-gallery.php` still reads `Author: Mullion` with `Author URI:` pointing at the GitHub repo. WordPress renders `Author:` as "By Mullion" in the plugins list, so today the product credits itself as its own vendor.

**Why it is deferred rather than done:** `Author URI:` needs a real destination. `astragalsoftware.com` is owned but the brief does not record a live site there, and pointing the field at a domain that does not resolve is worse than leaving it on the repo URL. Do this when the Astragal site (or a placeholder page) exists. The `Author:` string alone could move independently if preferred, but the pair reads oddly split.

**Also in the same family, when each surface is set up:** the Freemius seller of record (§A of the [Go-Live Punch List](guides/GO_LIVE_PUNCH_LIST.md)) and the GitHub organisation, per the designer's list. Neither is a code change in this repo.

**Effort:** Small (a two-line header edit) | **Impact:** Low-Medium — completes the vendor identity that the WP.org account started, and it is the field users actually see in wp-admin.

### Hover-Glow Default Over Hostile Imagery — designer verification screenshots

**Origin:** Designer response to the v2 design docs ([`docs/design/correspondences/designer-response-v2-notes.md`](design/correspondences/designer-response-v2-notes.md) §3), 2026-09-01. Non-blocking; nothing gates on it.

**Context:** The per-gallery hover-glow effect defaults to the brand teal `#1ad1c4` (`tileGlowColor` in `src/types/gallerySettings.ts`). The designer has no objection to the colour but notes the glow sits over **user photography** — the one place the brand colour meets content nobody controls. Rig Cyan is high-chroma and light: over a cyan-toned or pale image it may read as a wash rather than a glow; over a busy image, as an artefact. Per-image outcome, user-configurable, so not a palette fault — but unverified.

**What to implement:** Capture the default glow over three deliberately hostile cases — (1) a pale beach/sky image, (2) a teal-dominant image, (3) a very dark low-key image — in a seeded wp-env instance, and send the screenshots to the designer. If it survives those it is fine everywhere. Pairs naturally with the store screenshot capture pass (`STORE_ASSETS.md`), which needs the same seeded environment.

**Effort:** Small (an hour with a seeded environment) | **Impact:** Low-Medium — closes the last open designer sign-off on the shipped palette's defaults.

### Expand the Screenshot Capture Pass for the Astragal/Mullion Website

**Origin:** Raised by the user 2026-09-09 while reviewing the Phase 76 close-out. The 5 required WordPress.org screenshots are still uncaptured (`.wordpress-org/` does not exist yet), and the same seeded environment can produce marketing shots for the future Astragal/Mullion website at near-zero marginal cost.

**Context:** The 5 required WP.org screenshots (manifest in [`STORE_ASSETS.md`](design/STORE_ASSETS.md), order finalized in P76-K: Layout Builder canvas, hexagonal-adapter gallery, campaign management panel, lightbox, theme/adapter variety) need a seeded wp-env instance to capture — the same environment the hover-glow verification screenshots above also need. Once that environment exists, a handful of additional shots (other adapters, other themes, other device widths) cost little beyond the required 5, against standing the environment up a second time later.

**Why this stays deliberately unscoped:** the Astragal/Mullion website does not exist yet, so its actual asset needs — hero images, feature callouts, aspect ratios, light vs. dark theme by default — are unknown. Locking a shot list now would be guessing. This entry records the *decision* (bundle the extra capture into the same session) without prematurely scoping the *list*.

**What to do when the capture pass happens:** after the 5 required shots and the 3 hover-glow verification shots, spend one bounded extra pass — not open-ended — on a small set of additional variety (a few more adapters, a couple of alternate themes, one mobile-width shot) explicitly for future website use. Revisit the actual list once the website's design is underway and its needs are concrete. Tracked as part of the screenshot capture item on [PHASE83_REPORT.md](PHASE83_REPORT.md) §D.

**Effort:** Small (marginal time on top of an already-scheduled capture session) | **Impact:** Low — convenience for a future website build; nothing gates on it.

## Monetization & Distribution

### Naming Defense — Trademark Filings + Fallback Domains (human gate, no code)

**Origin:** Designer's naming review, 2026-09-01, completed 2026-09-09. **The full findings now live in [`docs/design/BRAND-CLEARANCE.md`](design/BRAND-CLEARANCE.md)** — a standalone reference card with both register tables, the trading namesakes, the domains, and an explicit list of what the check does not cover. That is the file to hand a solicitor; this entry is just the action list. All product-owner actions: nothing here is a repo change and none of it gates the release.

**Where it stands.** Both names were searched on the **official USPTO register** on 2026-09-09 (the earlier JS-gated gap is closed) and both are **clear: zero marks in Class 9, zero in Class 42.** Mullion's only live exact-word mark is a Japanese medical-catheter registration (independently re-verified here against TSDR, serial 79350332 / reg. 7296060, exact match). Astragal's only bare-word registration is dead. Each name has one unregistered trading namesake in an unrelated vertical.

**Actions, in priority order:**

1. **File intent-to-use in US Classes 9 and 42 for both names.** Both classes are empty for both marks; this closes essentially all the tail risk and is the highest-value single action. Add CIPO (Canada) for Astragal — that namesake prices in CAD.
2. **Do not file Astragal in Class 41.** ASTRAGAL PRESS (book publishing) is live there. Keep "publisher" as descriptive prose in `BRAND.md`, not as a service claim.
3. **Register `astragal.dev` and `getastragal.com`.** (`astragal.com` is unobtainable, held since 1999 with transfer locks; `astragalsoftware.com` is already ours.)
4. **Date-stamp first use in commerce** for both names — common-law rights accrue from use, and a dated record makes them provable.
5. **For a solicitor**, the two highest-value items: whether **Mullion, Inc.** (Bedford, NH) still trades, and the **first-use date of the astragalhq.com operator** (Cloudflare-shielded, unindexed, so a standard knockout search would miss them entirely). Plus EUIPO / UKIPO / IP Australia if those territories matter — all three were JS-gated and remain unsearched.

**Effort:** Small (human/administrative) | **Impact:** Medium — closes a slow-moving tail risk on both names before the first public release.

---

## Privacy & Compliance

**Origin:** [PHASE60_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE60_REPORT.md) P60-E — surfaced while auditing data handling for `docs/PRIVACY.md`. These are documented honestly in `PRIVACY.md`'s "Follow-Ons" as **known gaps**, not present features; each is a code change deferred out of the P60-E content track.

*"WordPress Core Privacy Integration (DSAR Export/Erase)" and "Retention / Auto-Purge for Email & Audit-Log Tables" were promoted to [PHASE72_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE72_REPORT.md) tracks **P72-B** and **P72-F** (2026-07-23) and removed from this backlog.*

### Google Fonts Self-Host Variant

**Origin:** Deferred from [PHASE69_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE69_REPORT.md) Follow-On Candidates (2026-07-21) — the docs-only fix (P69-A, documenting the existing Google Fonts data flow in `PRIVACY.md`) shipped; this is the both-sides code change split off from it.

**Files:** server-side font-file download/caching at settings-save time; client-side `loadGoogleFont.ts` (serve locally instead of injecting a Google-hosted `<link>`/`@font-face`); a system-font-stack fallback.

**Context:** The plugin's Google Fonts integration currently fires a third-party request (server-side `wp_enqueue_style` `<link>`, or client-side injection) whenever a Google Font is selected, disclosing the visitor's IP to Google. `PRIVACY.md §3` documents this data flow and its opt-outs, but a self-hosted variant — download the selected font files server-side at settings-save time, serve them locally — would eliminate the third-party request entirely for GDPR-conscious deployments.

**Effort:** Medium (a real, both-sides feature, not a documentation fix) | **Impact:** Low-Medium today — revisit if GDPR-conscious buyers specifically ask for a zero-third-party-request option.

---

### Server-Side (PHP) Sentry PII Scrubber

**Files:** `class-mullion-sentry.php` (parity with the browser-side `beforeSend` scrubber in `src/services/monitoring/sentry.ts`).

**Context:** The browser Sentry path strips `Authorization` headers and `user.ip_address`; the PHP path sends `$context` verbatim. Sentry is off by default (requires a DSN), so this is low-likelihood, but a scrubber should exist before recommending server-side error reporting.

**Effort:** Small | **Impact:** Low (off by default) but removes a footgun.

### Per-Day Salt Rotation for Analytics Visitor Hash

**Files:** `class-mullion-analytics-controller.php` (`record_analytics_event`).

**Context:** `visitor_hash = sha256(IP + wp_salt('auth'))` uses a static, non-rotating salt, so a given IP always hashes the same value — good for unique-visitor counts but re-identifiable for the small IPv4 space. Rotating the salt per day (bucketing the hash by date) reduces re-identifiability while preserving same-day uniqueness. Trade-off: cross-day unique counts become approximate.

**Effort:** Small | **Impact:** Low-Medium — hardens an already-pseudonymised field.

---

## Campaign Management

### Full Server-Driven `CardGallery` Host Pagination

**Origin:** [PHASE68_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE68_REPORT.md) Follow-On Candidates (2026-07-21). P68-A's fix loops all pages of `fetchCampaigns`/`fetchAllCampaignOptions` up front (via the shared `fetchAllPages` helper in `src/services/pagination.ts`) rather than truly paging the UI — that closed the original data-loss bug (only page 1 was ever fetched) without the larger UX change of true infinite/paged public browsing.

**Context:** `fetchAllPages`'s current usage still has a hard cap (`DEFAULT_MAX_PAGES × 50 = 1,000` campaigns/space) — structurally the same class of truncation as the original bug, just at a 100× higher, currently-unhit threshold, and with no user-facing signal if it is ever hit. True server-driven host pagination in `CardGallery` (fetch one page at a time as the visitor scrolls/pages, not all pages up front) would remove this cap entirely and reduce initial-load payload for large campaign counts.

**Effort:** Medium-Large (new host-pagination UX in the public gallery component, not just the data-fetching layer) | **Impact:** Low today — revisit only if a site's campaign count grows large enough that fetching all pages up front becomes its own performance concern.

---

### Campaign Binary Export — Stream Large Media Sets

**Files:** `class-mullion-export-engine.php`

P39-CM1 ships background ZIP generation via `Mullion_Export_Engine` with a 100 MB size limit. For larger campaigns, add chunked/streamed media fetching (write directly to the ZIP via `curl CURLOPT_FILE` rather than buffering each media body in memory) and a configurable size ceiling in settings. Most campaigns fall within the current 100 MB limit today.

**Dependencies:** `Mullion_Export_Engine` (shipped P39-CM1). `ext-zip` required.

**Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours) | **Impact:** Low — only relevant for campaigns exceeding the current 100 MB size ceiling

---

### Campaign-Filtered Media Export Misses Pre-Phase-65 ZIP-Imported Campaigns

**Origin:** Phase 65 post-landing PR review (2026-07-18) — [PHASE65_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE65_REPORT.md) "Post-Landing PR Review & Fix Pass".

**Context:** P65-B fixed `export_media_library_binary()` to filter a campaign's media by `attachmentId` instead of the always-zero `id`. But any campaign whose media was sideloaded via ZIP import **before** Phase 65 landed (when `attachmentId` was never stamped on sideloaded items) still has no `attachmentId` on those items — the campaign-filtered export silently returns an empty archive for exactly those campaigns, same symptom P65-B fixed, different root cause (stale data vs. wrong filter key). This is consistent with an existing codebase convention — `Mullion_CLI::media_orphans()` has the identical blind spot today, items without `attachmentId` are already invisible to it — but there is no signal anywhere distinguishing "campaign genuinely has no media" from "media exists but predates the `attachmentId` fix."

**What to implement:** Either (a) a one-time backfill/migration that stamps `attachmentId` on legacy sideloaded media items by matching `url` to an existing attachment, or (b) a softer fix: have `export_media_library_binary()`'s empty-result branch distinguish "campaign has zero `media_items`" from "campaign has `media_items` but none resolved an `attachmentId`," surfacing the latter as a warning instead of a silent empty export.

**Files:** `includes/rest/class-mullion-media-controller.php` (`export_media_library_binary()`); a backfill migration would also touch `includes/class-mullion-campaign-io.php`.

**Effort:** Small (warning signal) to Medium (backfill migration) | **Impact:** Low — only affects campaigns imported via ZIP before Phase 65; new imports are unaffected.

---

### Binary Campaign Export Downloads Non-File URLs for Embed/External Media

**Origin:** Surfaced during the Phase 65 post-landing PR review (2026-07-18) while verifying a fix for dropped `embedUrl`/`provider` fields — [PHASE65_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE65_REPORT.md) "Post-Landing PR Review & Fix Pass".

**Context:** `Mullion_Export_Engine::build_zip()` treats every `media_items[].url` as a downloadable file and fetches it via `wp_safe_remote_get()`. For `source:"external"`/`"oembed"` items (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) `url` is the original webpage link, not a media file — `normalize_external_media()` deliberately keeps the real embeddable link in a separate `embedUrl` field. So a binary (ZIP) campaign export either downloads garbage bytes (an HTML page) and stores them under a made-up filename, or the entry fails WordPress's file-type validation on re-import and silently lands in `media_skipped` — a video/embed item never meaningfully round-trips through the ZIP transport, only through JSON (where P65-D's fix already works, since JSON never touches `build_zip()`). This predates Phase 65 — the `build_zip()` download loop wasn't touched by the P65 commits — and is a deeper change than the metadata-preservation fix that shipped in the post-landing pass, so it was documented rather than fixed on the spot.

**What to implement:** In `Mullion_Export_Engine::build_zip()` (or upstream, before media items reach `create_job()`), skip items whose `source` is `external`/`oembed` — no real attachment bytes to fetch — rather than attempting to download `url`. The manifest already carries `embedUrl`/`provider` for these items (P65-D); a ZIP export should include them in the JSON manifest only, with no corresponding `media/` file, and `Mullion_Campaign_IO::sideload_media_items()` should recognize a media reference with no `filename` and route it through the URL-only path `build_url_media_items()` already uses for JSON imports, instead of trying (and failing) to find it in the archive.

**Files:** `includes/class-mullion-export-engine.php` (`build_zip()`), `includes/class-mullion-campaign-io.php` (`build_entry()`'s `filename` assignment, `sideload_media_items()`'s embed-ref handling).

**Effort:** Medium — touches the shared export engine and the P65-A service's import branching; needs new fixture coverage for a video/embed item through a real binary export→import | **Impact:** Medium — today the only transport where a video/embed campaign item survives a full round-trip is JSON; ZIP export/import of a campaign with embedded video content silently loses that item.

### Consolidate Duplicated Sanitization / Truncation-Flag Logic in the Campaign IO / Export Paths

**Origin:** Phase 65 post-landing PR review (2026-07-18) — [PHASE65_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE65_REPORT.md) "Post-Landing PR Review & Fix Pass". Noted but not fixed in that pass, to avoid widening the diff's blast radius on freshly-landed, already-tested consolidation code.

**Context:** Four small duplication/indirection items surfaced during the review, none a correctness bug:
1. `Mullion_Campaign_IO::build_url_media_items()`/`upload_media_item()`/`normalize_media_type()` re-derive the same type/source whitelisting `Mullion_Cpt::sanitize_media_items()` already implements as the registered meta sanitizer.
2. `Mullion_Campaign_IO::apply_scalar_meta()`'s inline `strtotime()`/`gmdate()` datetime normalization duplicates `Mullion_Cpt::sanitize_datetime()`.
3. The `total_available`/`truncated` truncation-flag computation (P65-C) is implemented near-identically in both `class-mullion-media-controller.php` and `class-mullion-campaign-controller.php`, with no shared helper.
4. `Mullion_Campaign_IO::import_entry()`'s `$opts['via']`/`$opts['format']` derivation is a residual per-transport special case — every call site already passes both explicitly, so the `??` defaults are unreachable, and `format` is fully derivable from whether `$zip` is passed.

**What to implement:** Route (1)/(2) through the existing `Mullion_Cpt` sanitizers instead of re-implementing them; extract (3) into a shared helper (alongside `Mullion_REST_Base::paginated_response()`/`parse_pagination()`); simplify (4) by having each call site pass an explicit `source` string instead of the `via`/`format` ternary.

**Files:** `includes/class-mullion-campaign-io.php`, `includes/class-mullion-cpt.php`, `includes/rest/class-mullion-media-controller.php`, `includes/rest/class-mullion-campaign-controller.php`.

**Effort:** Small-Medium | **Impact:** Low — maintainability only; no observed behavioral bug today.

## Access Control

Phase-owned follow-on in this area: per-campaign RBAC now lives in [PHASE33_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE33_REPORT.md). The remaining backlog items here are all prerequisites or components of the standalone cross-origin deployment scenario.

*Per-space authorization scoping of ephemeral export-job resources was promoted out of this backlog into Phase 63 and **completed** on 2026-07-15 — see [PHASE63_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE63_REPORT.md) Track **P63-I** (follow-on to P63-E / P63-E-2). Export-job read/download now enforces tier + creator-ownership + all-contributing-spaces.*

### Granular Custom-Role Permission Engine (GitHub-style)

**Files:** `includes/class-mullion-permissions.php` (introduced in P52-A), role/cap setup in `mullion-gallery.php`, a new admin UI + storage.

**Context:** P52-A establishes the authorization foundation as a centralized `Mullion_Permissions` action→requirement map — every protected action declares its required tier (`manage_options` / `manage_mullion` / per-space grant level) and scope in one place, with the named tiers (viewer / editor / owner / mullion_editor / admin) acting as fixed **presets** over that map. This future task is the optional **builder layer** on top of that foundation: let site admins compose **custom roles** from atomic capabilities (à la GitHub's Read/Triage/Write/Maintain/Admin presets plus Enterprise custom repository roles), with optional **per-space role overrides**.

**What it would take:**
- Promote the implicit atomic actions in the `Mullion_Permissions` map to first-class, individually grantable capabilities.
- A storage schema for custom role definitions (composition of base preset + added/removed atomic caps), and optional per-space scoping of those definitions.
- An admin UI to create/edit custom roles and assign them, plus a migration path from the fixed presets.
- Permission resolution that layers custom roles over the preset map without breaking the existing tier checks or the P52-A regression matrix.

**Rationale for deferral:** A full custom-role engine is a self-contained system (storage + UI + migration + resolution) whose cost is the management surface, not the enforcement. With only a handful of actor archetypes today, it is premature (YAGNI). The P52-A centralized map deliberately makes this work **additive rather than a rewrite** — revisit only if a concrete multi-tenant or custom-role requirement emerges. Deferred from [PHASE52_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE52_REPORT.md) Track P52-A (decided 2026-06-15).

**Effort:** High (multi-track / likely its own phase) | **Impact:** Low today; High if a multi-tenant custom-role need appears.

### CORS Origin Allow-List & Admin UI

**Files:** `mullion-gallery.php`, `class-mullion-settings.php`

Add a CORS allowed-origins admin setting and enforce it on REST API responses, rejecting wildcard (`*`) when credentials are used. Only affects cross-origin REST API usage; standard same-origin WordPress shortcode deployments are unaffected (WP core already reflects the request origin unconditionally for those).

**P39-CO1 deferral note (2026-06-01):** P39-CO1 attempted to promote this to a first-party settings-backed surface. Work was rolled back because CORS restriction provides no meaningful value for the primary use case — the plugin is embedded via WordPress shortcode and runs same-origin. This track becomes relevant only when Mullion is deployed as a standalone SPA on a different origin, which requires preparatory work (auth model, build changes, deployment docs) that is not yet in scope. Prerequisite for the JWT work below.

**Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours) | **Impact:** Low — meaningful only for standalone SPA deployments

---

### JWT In-Memory Token Auth (Standalone SPA)

**Context:** Phase 20 (P20-K) defaulted the plugin to nonce-only authentication and gated the JWT `localStorage` flow behind an opt-in flag (`MULLION_ENABLE_JWT_AUTH`) to eliminate the XSS → token-theft vector for the default deployment. However, if Mullion is ever deployed as a **standalone SPA on a different origin** (i.e. not embedded via shortcode), WP nonces are unavailable because they require a same-origin page load. In that scenario, JWT auth is required.

The JWT code (`src/services/auth/WpJwtProvider.ts`) is **live, working code today** — not commented out. It is simply not instantiated unless the site opts in: `getAuthProvider()` in `src/App.tsx` returns a `WpJwtProvider` only when `enableJwt === true` (backed by the `MULLION_ENABLE_JWT_AUTH` constant), otherwise a cookie/nonce `WpNonceProvider`. It stores tokens in `localStorage`, which is accessible to any script on the page. The secure alternative is:

1. **In-memory access token** — stored in a module-scoped variable (not `localStorage`). Survives only for the tab's lifetime.
2. **httpOnly refresh cookie** — issued by a new `/mullion/v1/token/refresh` endpoint with `SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly`. The browser sends it automatically; JS cannot read it.
3. **Silent refresh** — on app boot and before access-token expiry, `POST /mullion/v1/token/refresh` returns a fresh short-lived access token.

**What it would take:**
- New PHP endpoint: `POST /mullion/v1/token/refresh` — validates the httpOnly cookie, issues a new JWT with a 15-minute TTL.
- Modify `WpJwtProvider.ts` (live today, flag-gated — not commented out): replace `localStorage.setItem/getItem` with a module-scoped `let accessToken: string | null`.
- **Permissions-cache staleness (from the 2026-07-13 React review, § B-4, tracked as Phase 69 P69-E):** `WpJwtProvider.getPermissions()` returns the cached `mullion_permissions` `localStorage` entry with **no TTL** — it is only cleared on logout, so a revoked grant persists in the client UI until the user logs out (display-only; the server still enforces on every request). Fold the fix into this rework: add a TTL to the cache, or drop it entirely since the `/permissions` endpoint is cheap. See [PHASE69_REPORT.md → P69-E](archive/phases/PHASE69_REPORT.md#track-p69-e---jwt-providers-localstorage-permissions-cache-never-expires-tracking-only).
- Add a `useTokenRefresh` hook that calls the refresh endpoint 1 minute before expiry and on window `focus` events.
- `apiClient.ts`: attach `Authorization: Bearer <in-memory-token>` only when the env-var opt-in `Mullion_ENABLE_JWT=1` is set.
- Server-side: set the refresh cookie on `POST /mullion/v1/token` (login) and clear it on `DELETE /mullion/v1/token` (logout).
- CORS configuration for the cross-origin case (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, explicit origin).

**Open questions:**
- Q1: Should refresh-token rotation be implemented (invalidate old refresh cookie on each use)? This limits replay but adds a revocation table.
- Q2: What is the refresh-cookie TTL? 7 days (convenience) vs. 24 hours (security) — should it be admin-configurable?
- Q3: Is a `/mullion/v1/token/revoke-all` endpoint needed for the "log out everywhere" use case?

**Prerequisites:** P20-K must be complete (nonce-only default + JWT provider behind the `MULLION_ENABLE_JWT_AUTH` env-var gate). D-1 (CORS allow-list) must ship first to define the accepted cross-origin policy.

**P39-AU1 deferral note (2026-06-01):** P39-AU1 was gated on P39-CO1. Both tracks were deferred together — the CORS restriction work itself was rolled back because the primary deployment model (embedded WordPress shortcode) is same-origin and does not need cross-origin auth. The standalone SPA path requires the app to be prepared for that deployment model first (routing, build config, deployment documentation, CORS policy). Revisit when there is a concrete standalone SPA deployment requirement.

**Effort:** High (2–4 days) | **Impact:** High for cross-origin standalone SPA deployments; Low for standard WordPress shortcode usage

---

### JWT Token Refresh (Frontend)

**Files:** `src/services/apiClient.ts`, `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`

Transparent silent refresh of the in-memory JWT access token before expiry via a `useTokenRefresh` hook that posts to `/mullion/v1/token/refresh`. **Blocked on the JWT In-Memory Token Auth work above** (requires the in-memory token architecture and the `/token/refresh` PHP endpoint to exist first). Standard nonce-auth deployments are unaffected.

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** Low — only relevant for standalone SPA JWT deployments

---

## Settings & Admin UI

> Two prior entries — "Admin Notice on Unresolved Shortcode Space Reference" and "Unify settings-write authorization behavior (space-panel silent drop vs. explicit 403)" — were promoted to [PHASE72_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE72_REPORT.md) tracks **P72-D** and **P72-C** (2026-07-23) and removed from this backlog.

### Spaces Admin — UX Pass, Including Restore-Archived-Spaces

**Origin:** [PHASE75_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE75_REPORT.md) § Follow-On Candidates, from track **P75-J** (2026-08-26). The restore gap is what forced P75-J's decision (a) — a slug collision with an archived space had to be resolved by suffixing (`test` → `test-2`) rather than by pointing the user at the archived original, because there is no way to see or restore one. Widened to a full UX pass at the user's direction after manual QA of P75-I/J: *"currently it's a bit cumbersome, for one selecting a space, then switching tabs to change its configuration."*

**Context:** `SpaceManagementView` (rendered both in the admin-panel modal and standalone on the WP-admin **Spaces** page) is a four-tab surface — Spaces / Settings / Access / Library — where three of the four tabs are `disabled` until a space is selected, and selection happens only by clicking a row in the Spaces tab's table. Every configuration action therefore costs a tab round-trip. The specific frictions, in the order a user meets them:

1. **Select-then-switch-tabs.** The table row is the only way to choose a space, and the row offers no entry point of its own — no per-row "Settings" / "Access" / "Library" action, no expandable detail. Configuring a space is always: Spaces tab → click row → click a different tab. Doing two spaces in a row means going back to Spaces and repeating.
2. **The Settings tab holds a single button.** Its whole body is one `Configure display settings` button that opens the `SettingsPanel` **Drawer**. A tab whose only content is a button that opens another surface is a level of indirection with nothing in it — three interactions (tab, button, drawer) to reach a setting.
3. **Row selection is a bare `<tr onClick>`.** No `role`, no `tabIndex`, no keyboard path, and the only selected-state affordance is a background tint (`--mantine-color-blue-light`) plus `cursor: pointer`. This is an a11y gap as much as a UX one — the primary control of the screen cannot be reached from the keyboard.
4. **Archived spaces are invisible and unrecoverable.** The table filters `!s.archived`, and no filter, toggle, or restore action exists. `Mullion_Space_Controller::list_spaces` already accepts `include_archived` and `format_space` already returns `archived`, so the data side is done; there is no unarchive endpoint and no UI.
5. **The archive affordance misdescribes its outcome.** The trash icon is tooltipped "Archive space" and notifies `Space "…" archived` — both accurate — but the row then disappears with no archive to visit, which reads as a delete. P75-J's ambiguous "Failed to create space" was surprising precisely because of this: the user believed the space was gone.
6. **The create form is always-expanded at the bottom of the table** (for system admins), so the list and the creation flow compete for the same scroll position, and the form grows further when Delegated mode is switched on (it adds an `Alert`).
7. **Data already fetched is not shown.** `format_space` returns `grantCount` and the requesting user's `effectiveLevel` per space; the table shows neither, so "which spaces have grants?" needs a per-space tab visit.

**What to implement:** Treat this as a redesign pass, not a patch list — the items above mostly follow from one decision (list-plus-tabs vs. list-plus-detail), so settle that first:

- **Pick the navigation model.** The likely shape is a master/detail: the Spaces list stays the left/primary column, and selecting a space opens a detail region that carries Settings / Access / Library as *its* tabs, so selection and configuration are not separated by a tab switch. Per-row quick actions (a menu, or icon buttons) that jump straight to a specific detail tab would remove the round-trip for the common case.
- **Collapse the Settings indirection** — either inline the settings form into the detail region, or drop the tab and make it a row action that opens the Drawer directly.
- **Restore-archived-spaces.** Add an "Archived" filter/toggle to the list (the `include_archived` query param exists), show archived rows visibly distinct, and add an unarchive path: a `POST /spaces/{id}/restore` (or a `PUT` accepting `archived: false`) gated on `space.update`, plus the mutation and cache-bust wiring. Decide what a restore does when the slug has since been claimed by a suffixed successor — the most likely answer is restore-under-a-new-slug with the same message P75-J's 409 uses, but it must be decided rather than discovered.
- **Rename the archive affordance** to match what it does now that an archive exists to visit (or keep "Archive" and let the archived view be the thing that makes it true).
- **Keyboard/a11y for row selection** — a real control (radio, button, or `role="row"` + `tabIndex` + key handling) with a visible focus ring, not a tinted `<tr>`.
- **Surface `grantCount` / `effectiveLevel`** in the list columns.

**Files:** `src/components/Admin/SpaceManagementView.tsx` (the whole surface), `src/components/Admin/SpaceManagementModal.tsx`, `src/components/Admin/SpaceAssetLibrary.tsx`, `src/services/adminQuery.ts` (`useSpaces`), `wp-plugin/mullion-gallery/includes/rest/class-mullion-space-controller.php` (restore endpoint), `wp-plugin/mullion-gallery/includes/class-mullion-permissions.php` (gate for it).

**Dependencies / risk:** The component has two mount points (admin-panel modal and the standalone WP-admin page) with different widths — a master/detail layout has to work in both, which is the main design constraint and the reason this is a pass rather than a quick fix. `SpaceManagementView.test.tsx` drives the current tab structure directly (`clickTab('Access')`, `selectSpace(name)`), so the suite will need rewriting alongside, not after. The restore endpoint is additive and independently shippable — it can land before the layout work if the UX decision stalls.

**Effort:** Medium-Large (Medium for the restore endpoint + archived filter alone) | **Impact:** Medium-High — Spaces is the top-level organizing concept of the plugin and its admin surface is the most-used multi-step flow; the archived-space gap is also a correctness-adjacent hole users can fall into (P75-J).

### Opt-In "Mirror the Theme" Mode for Gallery Content Styling

**Origin:** Raised while scoping [PHASE76_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE76_REPORT.md) **P76-I** (2026-08-27), from the observation that the gallery's border settings are user-controlled *by design* — "as much control over how your gallery looks as possible" is the point of the product, so wiring those settings to the theme system automatically would be a mistake.

**Context:** There is currently **no** path from the theme system to gallery *content* styling, in either direction. The theme engine's tokens (`border`, `borderStrong`, `surface`, `primaryFill`, …) reach Mantine chrome via `adapter.ts` and the gallery shell via `--mullion-color-*`, but campaign cards, tiles, media, nav arrows, and the viewer are styled entirely from user settings with fixed defaults — `card_border_color` defaults to `#1ad1c4`, `tile_border_color` to `#ffffff`, and so on.

The nearest existing thing is not a precedent. `cardBorderMode` already selects a colour *source* — `'auto'` (the campaign's company `brandColor`), `'single'` (`settings.cardBorderColor`), `'individual'` (`campaign.borderColor`) — but none of the three consults the theme. `ResetLink` in the settings sections is a different axis entirely: it clears a responsive **breakpoint override** back to the desktop value, not to any theme.

So a site owner who picks a theme they like has no way to say "and make the gallery follow it" short of hand-copying hex values out of the theme and into a dozen settings, where they immediately go stale the moment the theme changes.

**What to implement:** An opt-in mode, per setting or per group, that *sources* the value from the active theme instead of from a stored constant. `cardBorderMode` shows the shape to copy: add a fourth mode (e.g. `'theme'`) alongside `auto` / `single` / `individual`, and generalise the same idea to the other content-styling colours.

**The design decision that matters: mirror, not copy.** A one-shot "Reset to theme" button that writes current theme values into the settings is the obvious implementation and the wrong one — the values are stale the instant the user switches theme, and nothing records that they were ever meant to track it. A *live* mode keeps the link, so changing theme restyles the gallery, and the user can drop back to a fixed colour whenever they want. It also keeps this compatible with the product's premise: mirroring is a choice the user makes and can revoke, not a default that quietly removes control.

Worth deciding at planning time: whether the granularity is per-field, per-group (all card colours), or a single global "gallery follows theme" switch; and which theme token each setting maps to (`card_border_color` → `primaryStroke`? `border`? `borderStrong`?), which is a design question per setting, not a mechanical one.

**Dependencies / risk:** Touches the settings schema (a new enum value or a companion "source" field per setting), the sanitizer, the PHP defaults, the adapter-fields schema, and the settings UI. The `adapterSettingsParity` guard will need the new keys. Space-level overrides and breakpoint overrides both already layer on these settings, so the resolution order — theme → setting → space override → breakpoint override — needs stating explicitly before implementation, not discovered during it. No accessibility coupling: **P76-I** deliberately does not depend on this, and its audit scope is theme-derived chrome only.

**Effort:** Medium-Large | **Impact:** Medium-High — it is the missing half of the theme feature. Themes currently restyle the admin and the gallery shell but stop at the content the user actually came to look at.

## Integration

### Third-Party OAuth Providers

**Context:** Authentication supports WP native + JWT. Google and GitHub OAuth would reduce friction for organizations whose members already have Google Workspace or GitHub accounts.

**Open questions:**
- Q1: Should OAuth be implemented directly in the plugin or via a WP OAuth hook (e.g. integrating with an existing OAuth plugin)? Direct implementation adds maintenance burden.
- Q2: The OAuth redirect lands on the WP host, not the embedding page — is a popup-window OAuth flow the right model when the gallery is embedded as a Web Component on a non-WP page?
- Q3: Which providers are highest priority? (Survey/feedback required before committing scope.)

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** Medium — valuable for SSO deployments, complex to implement correctly

---


### GraphQL API Alternative

**Context:** The REST API is adequate for the admin SPA but is verbose for external integrations that need only specific fields. A GraphQL endpoint allows consumers to request exactly the data they need.

**Open questions:**
- Q1: Is there sufficient external-integrator demand for a GraphQL API? This is a significant investment with unclear ROI unless there is a concrete use case.
- Q2: Build on `WPGraphQL` (broad adoption, reduces code) or a custom GraphQL endpoint (more control, adds a third-party dependency)?
- Q3: Would a GraphQL API make the REST API redundant, or would both coexist? Coexistence adds documentation and maintenance burden.

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** Low for current users, potentially High for ecosystem adoption

## Deferred Gallery Adapters

> **Origin:** Phase 8 brainstorm (P22). These gallery adapter concepts were identified as valuable additions but deferred from the active Phase 8 scope. They follow the existing `GalleryAdapterProps` contract and register via `registerAdapter` like all current adapters.

### Timeline Adapter
Chronological layout with items on alternating sides of a vertical center line. Date/caption labels at each node. Good for event-based or campaign-chronology galleries.
LOE: Medium | Impact: Low-Medium

### Grid with Variable Aspect-Ratio Tiles Adapter
Auto-assigns tile sizes (1×1, 2×1, 1×2, 2×2) based on media metadata (aspect ratio, resolution). Creates a densely packed, visually varied grid without manual configuration. Similar to Google Photos or Flickr's justified grid but with explicit CSS Grid tracks.
LOE: Medium-High | Impact: Medium

---

## Evaluation Criteria

When promoting future tasks to an active phase:

1. **User impact** — How many users does this affect, and how much does it improve their workflow?
2. **Implementation effort** — What is the realistic development time, including tests and documentation?
3. **Maintenance burden** — Does this add surface area that will need ongoing upkeep?
4. **Alignment with core mission** — Does this serve the gallery-management use case, or is it scope creep?
5. **Open questions resolved** — A task should not be promoted until its key design questions have answers.
6. **Dependencies satisfied** — Note which other features must ship first.

*Document created: February 1, 2026*
*Last updated: June 1, 2026 — Reconciled against current code and Phase 28 completions; removed shipped backlog items in two passes, moved promoted work fully into Phases 32–34, audited the remaining deferred review list, retired stale deferred entries (D-10, D-17, RD-4), removed entries queued into Phase 38, and kept the rest as long-tail reference material. Added D-15 (`get_campaigns_for_attachment_id` N+1 meta reads) from P38 PR review. Updated D-1 and JWT entries with P39-CO1/P39-AU1 deferral rationale after both tracks were rolled back — CORS restriction is unnecessary for the primary same-origin embedded WP use case.*

*Updated: June 3, 2026 (P39-CL1) — Removed "Webhook Support for Campaign Events" (shipped P39-IN1) and "Redis/Memcached Object Cache" (shipped P39-OC1); retired D-12 (rate-limiter object-cache docs, now covered by P39-OC1); added P39-IN1 and P39-OC1 to the ownership snapshot; updated Infrastructure & Performance section intro.*

*Updated: June 3, 2026 (P40-QA1) — Reconciled audit-domain backlog against Phase 40 outcome. "Audit Log Binary Export" (Campaign Management section) remains correctly deferred — `Mullion_Export_Engine` exists but the compliance use case is not yet active enough to justify promotion. No other audit-domain items require movement or promotion.*

*Updated: June 3, 2026 (P41-FT1) — Updated "Alignment Variants" (Builder section): P30-K (alignment spike) and P30-G (nested group hierarchy) are both complete as of Phase 30; removed the blocking-dependency language and marked the item as unblocked.*

*Updated: June 3, 2026 (P41-OL1/UN1/RD15) — D-2 (Overlay Library DB migration), D-5 (Pre-uninstall confirmation gate), and RD-15 (SlotPropertiesPanel IIFE extraction) marked complete; D-7 targeted for Phase 42.*

*Updated: June 3, 2026 (P42/P43 planning) — RD-2 targeted for Phase 43; line-count corrected from ~1822 to ~736 (heavy section components already extracted to `src/components/Settings/`); LOE revised to Medium (3-5 hours).*

*Updated: June 4, 2026 (P43/P44 planning) — D-7, RD-2, RD-9, RD-21 graduated to phase plans (PHASE42_REPORT.md, PHASE43_REPORT.md); Phase 44 audit plan created (PHASE44_REPORT.md).*

*Updated: June 4, 2026 (reorg) — Dissolved "Deferred Review Tasks" section; D-1, D-13, D-14, D-15, RD-17 moved to domain sections (Access Control, Infrastructure & Performance, Campaign Management); completed entries (D-2, D-5, RD-15) and already-addressed entries (D-10, D-17, RD-4) dropped.*

*Updated: June 7, 2026 (P47 planning) — Added "Gallery Spaces" section with four Phase 47 follow-on candidates: Cross-Space Campaign Move, Per-Instance Full-Bleed CSS Scoping, Per-Space Library Isolation (Overlays/Fonts), and Space-Scoped Rate-Limit Buckets.*

*Updated: June 7, 2026 (P46-D/E) — Auth components and Lightbox are now genuinely decoupled from all Mullion-internal imports. `safeLocalStorage`, `useSwipe`, and `scrollLock` moved from `@/utils/`/`@/hooks/` to `src/lib/`. `AuthBarFloating` Campaign type replaced with local generic `AuthBarCampaignItem`. The monorepo infrastructure step (npm workspaces, `packages/shared-utils/`, `packages/shared-ui/`) remains the open follow-on before actual npm package publication.*

*Updated: June 9, 2026 (P48 planning) — Promoted to Phase 48: "Accumulative Multi-File Selection with Per-File Preview" (P48-A), "Alignment Variants" (P48-B), "Per-Instance Full-Bleed CSS Scoping" (P48-C), "Space-Scoped Rate-Limit Buckets" (P48-D), "Audit Log Binary Export" (P48-E), "Media Library Binary Export" (P48-F), "Coverflow / 3D Adapter" (P48-G), "Mosaic / Pinterest Adapter" (P48-H). Retired as already shipped: "Spotlight / Hero Adapter" (`spotlight/SpotlightGallery.tsx`) and "Vertical Scroll Snap Adapter" (`scroll-snap/ScrollSnapGallery.tsx`) — both fully registered in `adapterRegistry.ts`.*

*Updated: June 9, 2026 (P49 planning) — Promoted to Phase 49: "Contributor Tooling & Documentation / Storybook" (P49-E), "Thumbnail Cache Index Scalability" (P49-F), "`get_campaigns_for_attachment_id()` N+1 Meta Reads" (P49-G). Developer Experience and Infrastructure & Performance sections removed as all entries are now promoted. Four new tracks promoted directly from planning suggestions (not previously in this doc): a11y audit (P49-A), bundle/perf audit (P49-B), i18n groundwork (P49-C), automated visual regression (P49-D).*

*Updated: June 9, 2026 (P50 planning) — Promoted to Phase 50: "Full Audit and Extraction to Shared Package" (P50-G), "Cross-Space Campaign Move" (P50-A), "Per-Space Library Isolation" (P50-B), "Service Worker Metadata Caching Enhancements" (P50-F), "Stacked / Deck Adapter" (P50-C), "Waterfall Adapter" (P50-E), "Isotope / Filterable Grid Adapter" (P50-D). Removed now-empty sections: Reusable Component / Utility Library, Gallery Spaces, Build & Bundle.*

*Updated: June 12, 2026 (P50-F follow-on) — Re-added Build & Bundle section with "Service Worker — Offline Support (App Shell Pattern)": deferred from P50-F after manual testing confirmed offline mode is unsupported by design (SW intentionally skips navigation/HTML caching to avoid stale-chunk failures after deploys). Full offline support requires a versioned app-shell cache with deploy-time busting.*

*Updated: June 17, 2026 (P54 planning) — Added the Phase 54 production-readiness review follow-ons (deferred from [PHASE54_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE54_REPORT.md), which is tight must-fix only): four LayoutBuilder enhancements (Editor UX Polish, Responsive/Per-Breakpoint Editing, Text/Caption Layers, Design-Tool Affordances) under Builder, ordered by user priority; "Gallery — Admin-Control Additions"; a new Code Quality & Refactoring section (adapter data extraction / registration-seam / field-map unification; large-file decomposition); Internationalization (full admin i18n migration — P54-B does user-facing only); Accessibility (full WCAG AA — P54-C does the front-end critical/serious baseline); and Monetization & Distribution (licensing/update infra), cross-linked to the new [MONETIZATION_OPTIONS.md](MONETIZATION_OPTIONS.md).*

*Updated: June 23, 2026 (P55/P56/P57 planning) — Promoted the entire **Code Quality & Refactoring** section (adapter data-extraction / registration-seam / field-map unification + large-file decomposition) to [PHASE55_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE55_REPORT.md); **Gallery — Admin-Control Additions** (all four pieces, incl. listing-mode exposure) to [PHASE56_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE56_REPORT.md); and the two **Settings & Admin UI** items plus the LayoutBuilder **Design-Tool Affordances** (swatches/eyedropper, persistent guides, rotation handles) and the layer-search slice of **Editor UX Polish** to [PHASE57_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE57_REPORT.md). Emptied sections (Code Quality & Refactoring, Settings & Admin UI) keep their headers with a "No tasks here yet" placeholder. Trimmed "Editor UX Polish" to its remaining deferred clipboard + alignment-shortcut pieces.*

*Updated: June 26, 2026 (P58–P61 planning) — Promoted LayoutBuilder **Editor UX Polish** → [PHASE58_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE58_REPORT.md) P58-A, **Responsive / Per-Breakpoint Editing** → P58-B, and **Text / Caption Layers** → [PHASE59_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE59_REPORT.md). Added four net-new LayoutBuilder tracks directly from planning (Starter Template Library, Marquee Multi-Select, Slot Entrance Animations, Auto-Grid Generator — P58-C/D/E/F). Added three new Builder backlog entries in their place (History Persistence, Reusable Symbol/Linked Slots, Slot Constraints/Pinning). Scoped the `.pot`/user-facing i18n slice and the admin-flow a11y slice into [PHASE60_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE60_REPORT.md) P60-B/P60-D while keeping the **full** admin i18n migration and **full** WCAG AA audit deferred as the WP.org public-listing gate. Promoted **Licensing + Update Infrastructure** → [PHASE62_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE62_REPORT.md) (Freemius premium target chosen); the free WP.org "lite" tier stays deferred.*

*Updated: June 26, 2026 (P58-A batch-1 execution) — Added Builder entry "LayoutBuilder — Align/Distribute Keyboard Shortcuts", deferred from [PHASE58_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE58_REPORT.md) P58-A during implementation (binding scheme needs design); the remaining P58-A pieces — clipboard, slot opacity, nudge steps — ship in batch 1.*

*Updated: June 29, 2026 (P58-B execution) — Added two Builder entries deferred from [PHASE58_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE58_REPORT.md) P58-B: "Published Responsive Canvas Sizing (Breakpoint Render Model)" (the on-page sizing / progressive-shrink problem needs a manual-testing pass + careful planning) and "Faithful Preview (Breakpoint Render + Runtime Effects)" (align the builder Preview path with the published render and surface glow/bounce/entrance/tilt effects in Preview).*

*Updated: July 10, 2026 (P62 freemium expansion) — The distribution model expanded from premium-only to **freemium** (free WP.org "lite" build + premium via Freemius). Promoted **Full WCAG AA Audit** → [PHASE62_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE62_REPORT.md) P62-H and **Store Listing Artwork** → P62-I and **removed both from the queue** (the Accessibility and Monetization & Distribution sections are now empty placeholders); the previously-deferred free WP.org "lite" tier is now **in scope** as P62-F–I (spike → code split → WCAG AA → WP.org submission).*

*Updated: July 11, 2026 (P62-H) — Added Accessibility entry "Structural a11y (axe) gate — grow coverage + fix found issues", deferred from P62-H after the component axe harness landed (the automatable half; the manual AT audit is a separate human task). Concrete backlog seeded from the harness's first findings in `LayoutTemplateList`.*

*Updated: June 30, 2026 (P59-A execution) — Added Builder entry "LayoutBuilder — Clickable / Linking CTA Text Layer", deferred from [PHASE59_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE59_REPORT.md) per user direction — Phase 59 ships single-style, non-interactive text layers; the linking/CTA variant (href + accessible anchor rendering + URL control) is split off as a follow-on.*

*Updated: June 30, 2026 (P59-D planning) — Added Code Quality & Refactoring entry "Roll Out `UnitScrubField` to Remaining Ad Hoc Numeric/Unit Inputs", deferred from [PHASE59_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE59_REPORT.md) P59-D per user direction — P59-D itself stays scoped to `TypographyEditor`'s fields; the rotation-scrub migration and a broader Settings/LayoutBuilder sweep are future-tasked.*

*Updated: July 5, 2026 (P60 post-phase PR review) — Added Internationalization entry "i18n Review Follow-Ons — Sentence Composition + Locale Re-Translation", deferred from the [PHASE60_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE60_REPORT.md) post-phase code-review pass: `ArchiveCompanyModal` sentence-fragment composition (needs `<Trans>`) and re-translating the four changed media-import toast strings across the five packs (fold in the `ru_RU` 3-plural). Both English-safe; the review's material fix (i18next colon-key resolution) shipped on-branch.*

*Updated: July 18, 2026 (Phase 65 post-landing PR review) — Added three Campaign Management entries deferred from the [PHASE65_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE65_REPORT.md) "Post-Landing PR Review & Fix Pass": "Campaign-Filtered Media Export Misses Pre-Phase-65 ZIP-Imported Campaigns" (legacy sideloaded media lacks `attachmentId`, narrow/consistent with an existing `media_orphans()` limitation), "Binary Campaign Export Downloads Non-File URLs for Embed/External Media" (a deeper, pre-existing gap surfaced while verifying the embedUrl/provider fix — video/embed items don't meaningfully round-trip through the ZIP transport), and "Consolidate Duplicated Sanitization / Truncation-Flag Logic in the Campaign IO / Export Paths" (four small reuse findings, no correctness bug). The two actual bugs found in that review (binary import dropping `embedUrl`/`provider`; multi-campaign batch export filename mismatch) were fixed on-branch, not deferred here.*

*Updated: July 23, 2026 (Phase 72 planning) — Created [PHASE72_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE72_REPORT.md) (Planned, 7 mixed-domain tracks). **Promoted and removed from this backlog:** "WordPress Core Privacy Integration (DSAR Export/Erase)" → P72-B, "Retention / Auto-Purge for Email & Audit-Log Tables" → P72-F, "Admin Notice on Unresolved Shortcode Space Reference" → P72-D, "Unify settings-write authorization behavior" → P72-C (Settings & Admin UI is now an empty placeholder), "`AdminPanel.tsx` — Extract the Remaining Tab-State Concerns" → P72-E, and the `LayoutTemplateList`-fix half of "Structural a11y (axe) gate — grow coverage + fix found issues" → P72-G (the "extend coverage further" half stays here, retitled). **Backfilled** (Follow-On Candidates from Phases 68-70 that were never recorded here — found while verifying the backlog is current, cross-checked every archived phase report's Follow-On Candidates table against this doc): "Full Server-Driven `CardGallery` Host Pagination" (PHASE68_REPORT.md, under Campaign Management), "Google Fonts Self-Host Variant" (PHASE69_REPORT.md, under Privacy & Compliance), "`ApiClient` Facade → Namespaces" and "Promote Inline Sub-Components" (both PHASE70_REPORT.md, under Code Quality & Refactoring) — none of the four were promoted into Phase 72, since each is explicitly conditional/opportunistic in its own origin phase's deferral rationale, not bounded phase-shaped work.*

*Updated: August 27, 2026 (P76-I-1) — Added Code Quality & Refactoring entry "Three e2e specs fail on a clean tree", found while verifying P76-I-1 and confirmed pre-existing against an unmodified tree. Not deferred work from Phase 76; filed so a permanently-red e2e floor has an owner.*

*Updated: August 28, 2026 (P76-I-2 decision) — Added Accessibility entry "Two-Tone (Halo) Focus Ring", deferred from P76-I-2 after Option A (re-point the ring at `primaryStroke`) was selected. Recorded as a complementary layer on top of A, not a competing option; Options B (lift `primaryFill`) and C (accept the gap) were dropped outright and are deliberately not carried here.*

*Updated: August 28, 2026 (P76-I-2 implementation) — Added Code Quality & Refactoring entry "`global.scss` rules aimed at portaled admin chrome are dead in shadow mode", found while implementing the focus-ring override and confirmed by measuring which selectors reach `document.styleSheets`. Two rules are affected (`select-option[data-selected]`, `tabs-tab`); fixing them changes appearance, so it is deliberately not folded into P76-I-2.*

*Updated: August 28, 2026 (Phase 76 retrospective) — Added three architectural spikes to Code Quality & Refactoring after the user challenged the project's visual architecture as accumulating workarounds: "One Canonical Style-Delivery Seam", "Re-evaluate the Shadow-DOM Mount Strategy", and "UI Component Dependency: Mantine, Alternative, or In-House". They are sequenced deliberately — the dependency question runs last, because Phase 76's evidence attributes most of the pain to the shadow/portal boundary rather than to Mantine, and resolving that first materially narrows the case for replacement. The existing "Portal Admin Chrome Into the Shadow Root" entry is retained as the tactical version of one mount-strategy option.*

*Updated: August 28, 2026 (Phase 77/78/79 planning) — **Promoted and removed:** the three architecture spikes added earlier today ("One Canonical Style-Delivery Seam", "Re-evaluate the Shadow-DOM Mount Strategy", "UI Component Dependency") became [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) tracks A, B and E; "`global.scss` rules aimed at portaled admin chrome are dead in shadow mode" became P77-C; "Three e2e specs fail on a clean tree" and "Vacuous e2e test — theme-qa persists to localStorage" merged into P77-D. The UI facade became [PHASE78_REPORT.md](PHASE78_REPORT.md), and the former Phase 77 (release pipeline hygiene) was renumbered to Phase 79, later Phase 82 ([PHASE82_REPORT.md](PHASE82_REPORT.md)) — the user chose to settle the visual architecture before release rather than ship on top of it. "Portal Admin Chrome Into the Shadow Root" is **not** promoted: it is retained, marked superseded, as the risk analysis behind option (a) of P77-B.*

*Updated: September 1, 2026 (designer response to the v2 design docs) — **Promoted:** "Two-Tone ('Halo') Focus Ring" to [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) track P77-F, on the designer's build-it sign-off plus the two constraints that were its open design questions (neutral halo from the theme's own grounds; constant ring geometry across themes). **Added:** new Design & Brand section with "Hover-Glow Default Over Hostile Imagery" (three verification screenshots for the designer, non-blocking), and Monetization & Distribution entry "Naming Defense — Trademark Filings + Fallback Domains" (product-owner actions from the designer's §0, none gating design or release). The remaining code/doc items from the same response — `accentPurple: #923bde` on `default-light`, ΔE unit labels, the v1 criterion-wording record, the screenshot-manifest reorder — went to [PHASE76_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE76_REPORT.md) as tracks P76-J and P76-K rather than here, since Phase 76 is the in-progress colour-follow-ons phase.*

*Updated: September 9, 2026 (second designer response; Mullion trademark check completed) — **Updated:** "Naming Defense" entry with the completed Mullion register check (clear in US Classes 9/42, cleaner than Astragal; one detail — the Mullion Group's FLINTPRO cancellation/ownership transfer — reported by the designer but not independently confirmable, two lookup paths blocked) and the two named gaps carried forward (USPTO phonetic search, UK/EU Class 9 exposure from an unrelated "Mullion" safety-gear mark). The Mizuho Class 010 catheter registration the designer cited was independently verified against a live TSDR fetch and matches exactly (serial 79350332, reg. 7296060). No new FUTURE_TASKS entries this round — the remaining items (two brand-kit corrections, the `accentPurple` fix, the Archivo typography question, the WP.org account vendor-slug recommendation) went to [PHASE76_REPORT.md](archive/phases/PHASE76_REPORT.md) P76-J (closed) and P76-L (in progress), since Phase 76 already owns that thread.*

*Updated: September 9, 2026 (P76-C closed) — **Added:** Design & Brand entry "Move the Plugin Header `Author:` / `Author URI:` to Astragal", deferred out of P76-C because `Author URI:` needs a live destination to point at. The WordPress.org account (`astragal`) is registered and the `Contributors:` field now credits it; the naming-defense entry was also rewritten to point at the new [`docs/design/BRAND-CLEARANCE.md`](design/BRAND-CLEARANCE.md) reference card rather than restating the findings.*

*Updated: September 9, 2026 (Phase 76 closed; Phase 80 drafted) — **Added:** "Expand the Screenshot Capture Pass for the Astragal/Mullion Website" to Design & Brand — the 5 required WP.org screenshots are still uncaptured, and the same seeded environment can produce marketing shots for the future website at near-zero marginal cost. Deliberately left unscoped (the website does not exist yet); the bounded version is folded into the go-live phase ([PHASE83_REPORT.md](PHASE83_REPORT.md)) track P83-D. Phase 76 is now archived at [`archive/phases/PHASE76_REPORT.md`](archive/phases/PHASE76_REPORT.md); links to it above corrected accordingly.*

*Updated: September 9, 2026 (P77-A implementation) — No new entries. Two findings were routed straight into [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) instead: the `MediaCard` / `MediaTab` CSS modules are dead in the shipped shadow mount (added to P77-C alongside the `global.scss` rules, which turned out to be dead per surface rather than per rule), and the plugin enqueues only the entry chunk's CSS so Mantine's base stylesheet reaches the production document only when a dynamic chunk preloads it (proposed as P77-G, awaiting a decision).*

*Updated: September 9, 2026 (P77-C implementation): No new entries. The three `global.scss` state rules and the two Media CSS modules are fixed and recorded in [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md); the one finding that outlives the track (the Admin panel's own Select dropdown portals to the document and resolves no `--mantine-*` variable under the shipped mount) is logged there as a data point for P77-B rather than filed here, because B decides the boundary that causes it.*

*Updated: September 9, 2026 (P77-B decision): **Decided:** "Portal Admin Chrome Into the Shadow Root" is struck through; the option it described was prototyped, measured to fail inside transformed ancestors, and replaced by an overlay root, recorded in [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) P77-B. **Added:** "Share One Constructable Stylesheet Between the Gallery Root and the Overlay Root" (Code Quality), "Focus Return After Closing Portaled Chrome Lands on `body`" and "WordPress Admin Bar Covers the Settings Drawer Header for Logged-In Users" (Accessibility), all found during the B measurements and independent of the boundary decision.*

*Updated: September 9, 2026 (P77-F implementation): No new entries. The promoted "Two-Tone (Halo) Focus Ring" entry above is delivered in [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) P77-F: a derived neutral halo token, the ring rule through the P77-A canonical channel, and the WCAG 1.4.11 audit re-modelled as a pair guarantee. The designer's in-situ review remains open and is tracked on the phase report, not here.*

*Updated: September 10, 2026 (P77-E and P77-H delivered): No new entries. The UI dependency evaluation is [UI_DEPENDENCY_EVALUATION.md](UI_DEPENDENCY_EVALUATION.md) (recommends an in-house component layer on headless primitives behind the Phase 78 facade, primitive settled by a spike, Mantine headless as the fallback) and the in-house framework study is [IN_HOUSE_UI_FRAMEWORK_STUDY.md](IN_HOUSE_UI_FRAMEWORK_STUDY.md). Two candidates were routed to [PHASE77_REPORT.md](PHASE77_REPORT.md) Follow-On Candidates rather than filed here because they depend on the user re-planning Phase 78: the primitive spike, and lazy-loading admin chrome so the visitor path stops shipping `vendor-mantine-core` statically (P77-E section 4.3 measured that the visitor bundle is a code-splitting question more than a library question).*

*Updated: September 10, 2026 (host decoupling): **Added:** "Host Decoupling: Run Mullion on Any Web App (Mullion-next)" to Code Quality & Refactoring, at the user's request. Recorded as an umbrella entry over the existing standalone-SPA items in **Access Control** (JWT auth, CORS allow-list, JWT refresh), which turn out to be one of its three possible meanings rather than separate work. The entry deliberately does not pick between the three meanings (headless WordPress, pluggable host, portable product); that is its first open question and it should not be promoted before the user answers it.*

*Updated: September 10, 2026 (P77-E accepted, phases re-planned): No new entries. The user accepted the P77-E recommendation and chose to build the in-house component framework before release. The work is now [PHASE78_REPORT.md](PHASE78_REPORT.md) (boundary, primitive bake-off, token model), [PHASE79_REPORT.md](PHASE79_REPORT.md) (framework core and theme manager), [PHASE80_REPORT.md](PHASE80_REPORT.md) (behavioural components) and [PHASE81_REPORT.md](PHASE81_REPORT.md) (migration and Mantine removal). Release pipeline hygiene moved from Phase 79 to [PHASE82_REPORT.md](PHASE82_REPORT.md) and go-live from Phase 80 to [PHASE83_REPORT.md](PHASE83_REPORT.md); links above are corrected. Two backlog items are now owned by the new phases and stay here only until those phases land: "Share One Constructable Stylesheet Between the Gallery Root and the Overlay Root" becomes part of P79-B, and the WordPress admin bar covering the drawer header is closed by the host-safe layer token in P78-C.*

*Updated: September 10, 2026 (P77-I, Phase 77 closed): No new entries. The portal default is now `overlay-root`, so the two accessibility entries that describe the old placement are re-scoped rather than removed: "Focus Return After Closing Portaled Chrome Lands on `body`" is unchanged and still real, because it is Mantine's `useFocusReturn` reading `document.activeElement` rather than a placement problem, and it is closed by the framework in Phase 80 where all three headless candidates resolve the active element through the shadow tree. "WordPress Admin Bar Covers the Settings Drawer Header" is likewise unchanged and is owned by the host-safe layer token in P78-C. One test-integrity fix landed with P77-I and is recorded there rather than here: `playwright.config.ts` defaulted to Vite's port 5173, another project on the machine was serving it, and `reuseExistingServer` ran the whole suite against that application, producing 45 phantom failures.*

*Updated: September 12, 2026 (P79-B delivered): **Removed:** "Share One Constructable Stylesheet Between the Gallery Root and the Overlay Root" (Code Quality). It was owned by P79-B since the Phase 78 to 81 re-plan and is now built: one registration list (`src/ui/styles/uiStyles.ts`, with the app's entries in `src/appStyles.ts`) becomes one `CSSStyleSheet` per page that `MullionProvider` adopts into every root it paints, with a `<style>` fallback where constructable sheets are missing. The overlay root and the gallery root no longer carry hand-written copies, and the two-instance e2e measures four roots sharing one parsed sheet. Details in [PHASE79_REPORT.md](PHASE79_REPORT.md) P79-B.*
